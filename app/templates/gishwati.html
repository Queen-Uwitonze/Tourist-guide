        <h2>Gishwati-Mukura</h2>
        <p>Gishwati-Mukura National Park is situated on the highest ridges of the Congo-Nile Divide along the
          incredibly
          biodiverse Albertine Rift in the west of the country.
          Created only in 2015, this is Rwanda’s newest national park and one that plays an incredibly important role …
          not
          only in biodiversity conservation, but also in preserving and improving ecosystem services and in providing
          an
          economic engine for the upliftment of the surrounding communities that are integrally involved in its
          protection.</p>

        <p>Here visitors can experience not only chimpanzee and primate tracking, pristine montane forests and some of
          Rwanda’s most exciting birding, but can also engage with friendly, rural people and know that their visit
          will make
          a difference!.</p>
