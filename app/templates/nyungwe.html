          Africa.this
          walk is also an activity not to be missed in Rwanda. In case you are coming to Rwanda to trek the mountain

          safari

          people, you will see the monkeys move around in the tree tops, the birds that are flying above you and below
          you
          and a beautiful view of the huge Nyungwe forest. It’s also an amazing sight. This canopy walk is also 90m
          long
          which is not a long distance, however, it’s when you are 50 m above the ground.</p>
